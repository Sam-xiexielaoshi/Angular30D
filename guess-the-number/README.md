# 🎮 Day 4 - Guess The Number Game (Angular)

Welcome to **Day 4** of the Angular 30-Day Challenge!  
Today, we're building a fun and interactive **"Guess The Number"** game using Angular!

---

## 🧠 Project Description

In this project, the computer randomly selects a secret number, and the player has up to **10 chances** to guess it correctly.

💡 After every guess, the game gives helpful feedback:
- "Too high" 📈  
- "Too low" 📉  
- "Correct!" 🎉  

If the user guesses correctly within the limit — **they win**!  
If they run out of attempts — **game over**.
