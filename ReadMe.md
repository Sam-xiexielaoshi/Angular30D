# 🌟 30 Days Angular Project Challenge

Hi! I’m **Sam**, and this is my 30-day journey to mastering **Angular** by building a complete working project while learning core Angular concepts step-by-step.

This repository will include:
- Daily Angular concepts and implementation
- Code demos
- Progress updates

---

## 📌 Objective

To **learn and implement Angular** by practicing every day, focusing on real-world project building and strengthening frontend development skills.

## 🧠 What is Angular?

**Angular** is a **TypeScript-based** open-source web framework maintained by **Google**. It helps build **single-page applications (SPAs)** using a component-based architecture. 

### 🛠️ Key Features:
- Component-driven development
- Two-way data binding
- Dependency injection
- Routing for SPA
- RxJS and reactive programming

> 🔁 Note: This challenge uses **Angular 2+**, not the older AngularJS (v1.x).
